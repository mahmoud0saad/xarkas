         tourists visiting the Hawaiian
         islands, have also plagued scientists with a long-running mystery: If
         they are so close together,
         how did they develop in two
         parallel tracks along the Hawaiian-Emperor chain formed over the same
         hot spot in the Pacific
         Ocean — and why are their
         chemical compositions so different? "We knew this was related to
         something much deeper,
         but we couldn’t see what,” said
         Tim Jones.
